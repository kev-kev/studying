# Given an array of integers, find the amount of subsets of the array that add up to a given number
# EX: given [2, 4, 6, 10] and 16, we would return 2 because the only possibilities are [2, 4, 10] and [6, 10]

# -- Brainstorming --
# Questions- Do we have any duplicates in the array? Any negative numbers?
# If given a target of 0, return 1 from the function, since using none of the numbers counts as a way to make 0
