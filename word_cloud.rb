# You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

# To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a hash â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

# keep track of two indices, i and j. 
# walk through each char of the string, increasing i at each iteration, and check if the char is a space. 
# if it's a space, we need to add the trim of that word to the hash if it doesn't exist, and increase the value by one if it does
# if the char isn't a space, 
require 'set'
